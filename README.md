# **Kotlin Backend with Ktor**
This project is a RESTful API developed in  **Kotlin** using the **Ktor** framework, following **Clean Code** principles. The backend uses **Exposed**  as the ORM to interact with the database and **Flyway** for migration management.

## üë®‚Äçüíª **Technologies**

- **Kotlin**: Modern JVM programming language.
- **Ktor**: Lightweight framework for building asynchronous servers and clients.
- **Exposed**: SQL framework for Kotlin.
- **Flyway**: Database migration tool.
- **PostgreSQL**: Relational database.
- **Docker**: Container platform.
- **Docker Compose**: Multi-container Docker applications.

## üöÄ **Get Started**

**Prerequisites**

Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system
Git (optional for cloning)

1. Clone the repository
```bash
  git clone https://github.com/JhessReyes/backend-test/
  cd ./backend-test
```
2. Launch the application with Docker Compose
```bash
  docker-compose up --build
```
The API will be available at http://localhost:8080

### ‚≠êÔ∏è Core Functionality

- **Automatic data fetch on startup from external API**  
  Upon application launch, it fetches data from the public Counter-Strike API and stores all relevant records in the local database for exclusive use from that point forward.

- **RESTful API for entity management**  
  Provides endpoints to retrieve data from:
  - üéØ Skins  
  - üë• Agents  
  - üì¶ Crates  
  - üîë Keys  

- **Advanced search and filtering**  
  Allows dynamic filtering by name, description, crateName, etc.  
  Example: `/skins?crateName=Kilowatt Case`

- **Readable and connected data responses**  
  Displays descriptive names instead of raw IDs.  
  Example: shows `"Kilowatt Case"` instead of `"crate-4904"`.

- **Search result export to XML**  
  Any filtered result can be exported as XML via:  
  `/skins/xml?crateName=Kilowatt Case`

- **Authentication-protected section using Basic Auth**  
  The `Keys` section is secured using Basic Auth with

- **Search caching for performance optimization**  
  Frequently repeated queries are cached to improve response times and reduce database load.

- **Database versioning with Flyway migrations**  
  Database schema and optional seed data are automatically managed at startup to ensure consistency across environments.

- **Fully containerized with Docker & Docker Compose**  
  The project can be launched with a single command:
  down with:
  ```bash
     docker-compose down -v
  ```
  up with:
  ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
  ```

## **Project Structure**

El proyecto est√° organizado seg√∫n una arquitectura limpia, con las siguientes carpetas principales:
- `api/v1`: Contains the services, utilities, and route definitions.
- `api/v1/requests/`: JSON serialization for incoming request payloads.
- `api/v1/responses/`: JSON serialization for API response payloads.
- `api/v1/routes/`: Exposed API routes.
- `api/v1/services/`: Business logic related to the API.
- `api/v1/utils/`: Utility functions used across the API.
- `database/`: Modules responsible for interacting with the database.
- `database/migrations/`: Class that handles table structure migrations using Flyway.
- `database/models/`: Database entities and table schemas (managed via Exposed).
- `database/repositories/`: Interfaces that define the data source access.
- `database/repositories/impl`: Implementations of the repository interfaces, responsible for resolving and dispatching data.
- `database/seeder`: Contains the logic for bulk inserting data fetched from the external API.
- `resources/db/migration`: Contains the logic for migration DB SQL.
